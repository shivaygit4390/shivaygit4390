# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nirmal Singh

Iâ€™m an aspiring **Frontend Developer** with a strong foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**, along with experience integrating backend services using **Appwrite**.

I have developed a full-fledged blogging platform that showcases my ability to build functional, responsive, and user-focused web applications. This project reflects my hands-on understanding of frontend development and real-world application structure.

Additionally, I completed a **3-month internship at SRDT Pvt. Ltd., Lucknow**, where I was exposed to core web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, further strengthening my development skills.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on my **problem-solving skills through DSA** and beginning my journey into backend technologies with the goal of becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

Iâ€™m eager to join a collaborative team where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and grow as a developer.  
Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me for entry-level opportunities.
