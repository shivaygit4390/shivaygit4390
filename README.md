# 👋 Hi, I'm Nirmal Singh

💼 **Full-Stack Web Developer** with 1+ year of professional experience, currently working at **Impakable Solutions**, building and maintaining production-ready web applications for real clients.

I specialize in developing **scalable, maintainable, and secure systems**, with hands-on ownership across frontend, backend integrations, deployment, and ongoing production support.

---

## 🧩 Professional Summary

I work across both frontend and backend layers of modern web applications.  
On the frontend, I build responsive and maintainable interfaces using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
On the backend, I develop APIs and integrations using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Supabase**, handling authentication, role-based access control, secure data storage, and third-party services.

I take ownership of projects **end to end**—from development and hosting setup to deployment, monitoring, and post-launch maintenance. My experience includes working with payment systems, OTP workflows, document management, admin dashboards, and resolving production issues in live environments.
