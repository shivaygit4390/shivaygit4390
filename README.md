# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nirmal Singh

Iâ€™m a Software Developer focused on building clean, responsive, and scalable web applications using modern tools and frameworks, with a strong foundation in JavaScript and React.js.

I built BlogSpire, a full-stack blogging platform featuring user authentication, personalized dashboards, post creation with rich-text editing, image uploads, post status toggling, and client-side caching. Itâ€™s built using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite.

At Impakable Solutions, I handle the end-to-end development cycle of client websites. I primarily use React.js and Tailwind CSS to build responsive, maintainable UIs, adapting based on client design and content needs. Depending on the project, I also work with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for lightweight builds. I handle hosting through cPanel and integrate backend workflows using Google Apps Script for tasks like form submission and data storage.

Iâ€™m now looking for full-time Software Developer roles where I can work with modern stacks, contribute to meaningful products, and grow as a developer. Previously, I also interned at SRDT Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and React.js.
